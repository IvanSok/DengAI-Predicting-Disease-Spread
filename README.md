# DengAI-Predicting-Disease-Spread

This task is part of DengAI ongoing competition to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.

An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.

Results:
After spending approximately 5 hours on this problem, I have achieved an MAE of 26.9808, which currently has a ranking of 1824 out of total 6969 competitors. Further improvement could be done by applying PCA and splitting the dataset by cities.
